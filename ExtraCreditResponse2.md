## Data Science Alumni Speaker (July 24) - Extra Credit

  On Friday, July 24, I attended the fourth Data Science alumni speaker series with Ben Arancibia and Jasper Lu.  Ben is a data scientist at GSK, so it was interesting to learn more about how data analytics is used in the pharamaceutical industry, especially now that there is an accelerated need for a COVID-19 vaccine.  For example, Ben discussed that there was traditionally a divide between the employees with advanced-level degrees who designed the pharamaceutical research studies and the analysts who inspected the data yielded from the research.  The research study designers, who often had Ph.D's in a math-related field, would review the work of the analysts to validate the results and the mathematical analysis used on the data.  However, now that pharmaceutical companies are seeking a quick-to-market vaccination for COVID-19, they are looking to hire more analysts that can use computers to automate this validation process.
