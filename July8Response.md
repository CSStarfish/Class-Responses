**A. In the video, First steps in computer vision, Laurence Maroney introduces us to the Fashion MNIST data set and using it to train a neural network in order to teach a computer “how to see.”  One of the first steps towards this goal is splitting the data into two groups, a set of training images and training labels and then also a set of test images and test labels.  Why is this done?  What is the purpose of splitting the data into a training set and a test set?**

*  For a computer to "see" and image and correctly identify that image, a model must be created by training the computer's neural network on a set of training data and then testing its accuracy on test data.  The data is split into testing and training images/labels so that the neural network can use one set (the training set) to "learn" what each image is labeled as.  The neural network then uses what it knows to be correct from the training set to create a model to predict what future images should be labeled as.  However, the model then can't be tested for accuracy on the same training set because it already knows what those images are supposed to depict.  Consequently, the neural network must have a separate training set of images on the side so that we can evaluate it's ability to accurately predict images it has never seen before.

**B. The fashion MNIST example has increased the number of layers in our neural network from 1 in the past example, now to 3.  The last two are Dense layers that have activation arguments using the relu and softmax functions.  What is the purpose of each of these functions.  Also, why are there 10 neurons in the third and last layer in the neural network.**
    
*  The "relu" activation agrument essentially eliminates negative classification label outputs by setting negative inputs equal to zero, and the "softmax" activation argument helps find the most likely classification label candidate.  In this particular neural network, there are 10 neurons in the third and last layer because these corresponsd to each of the ten types of clothing classificiation possibilities.  In short, these ten neurons will determine the probability that the image represents each of the ten clothing items.
   
**C. In the past example we used the optimizer and loss function, while in this one we are using the function adam in the optimizer argument and sparse_categorical-crossentropy for the loss argument.  How do the optimizer and loss functions operate to produce model parameters (estimates) within the model.compile() function?**

*  In this particular neural network, the loss function is set to "sparse_categorical-crossentropy" to determine the cross entropy loss between the correct classification labels and the predicted classification labels, where the labels are integers.  Cross entropy loss is also known as log loss, and it seeks to minimize the difference between the probability of the actual classification label and the probability of the predicted classification label being equal to the actual classification label. (Finish this question.)

**D. Using the mnist drawings dataset (the dataset with the hand written numbers with corresponding labels) answer the following questions.**

*   1. What is the shape of the images training set (how many and the dimension of each)?
*   2. What is the length of the labels training set?
*   3. What is the shape of the images test set?
*   4. Estimate a probability model and apply it to the test set in order to produce the array of probabilities that a randomly selected image is each of the possible numeric outcomes (look towards the end of the basic image classification exercises for how to do this — you can apply the same method applied to the Fashion MNIST dataset but now apply it to the hand written letters MNIST dataset).
*   5. Use np.argmax() with your predictions object to return the numeral with the highest probability from the test labels dataset.
*   6. Produce the following plot for your randomly selected image from the test dataset:
