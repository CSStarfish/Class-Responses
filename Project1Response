I implemented the social distance detector with two different videos - one taken from a bird's eye view and one taken from the horizon.

**1. Was your social distance detector effective at detecting potential violations?**

**2. Do you think this approach would be effective for estimating new infections in real time?  How would you implement such an approach in response to the COVID-19 pandemic we are currently experiencing?**

**3. What limitations or improvements might you include in order to improve your proposed design?**
