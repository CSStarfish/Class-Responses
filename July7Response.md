2. With the first basic script that Maroney used to predict a value output from the model he estimated (he initially started with 10 that predicted ~31.  
Modify the predict function to produce the output for the value 7.  Do this twice and provide both answers.  Are they the same?  Are they different?  Why is this so?

For the first prediction, the output was 21.99994.  The loss on the final epoch (i.e., 500/500) was 1.3511e-09.  For the second prediction, the output was 21.999409.
The loss on the final epoch for this second prediction was 1.2854e-07.  While the predictions were extremely close at approximately 30, they were still slightly different. 
In addition, while the losses were both extremely small, the loss was 100X larger for the second prediction.
